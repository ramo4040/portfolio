			"RH CAR's rental operations, managed manually via phone calls, paper, and Excel, suffered from significant inefficiencies before this project. This traditional approach often caused scheduling conflicts and inconsistencies due to the lack of a centralized system. It also led to an exhaustive administrative workload as staff manually handled all availability checks and bookings. Crucially, unstructured damage tracking complicated vehicle maintenance and delayed their return to service.",
			'I developed a web-based platform that lets customers book cars online and gives staff real-time control over the fleet. This streamlined operations, reduced errors, and improved both internal workflows and customer satisfaction.'
